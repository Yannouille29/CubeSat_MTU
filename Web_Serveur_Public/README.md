# Project Description

This GitHub repository contains code for the "public" server intended for deployment on a specific domain. It essentially serves as a copy of the initial repository, with adjustments made for public dissemination.

## Public Server vs. Local Server

The "public" server is configured to be broadcasted on a specific domain. However, it's important to note that in this context, the 3D visualization tool included in the server might not function optimally if the ground station is not on the same Wi-Fi network as the component hosting the server.

## Replacement of Real-Time Visualization

In this particular context, we have replaced the real-time visualization function with alternative content, such as a video or other media. This is due to the ground station and the server-hosting component not sharing the same Wi-Fi network, affecting real-time communication.

## Accessing Real-Time Visualization

To access the real-time visualization feature, it's imperative to develop and run the server locally. This ensures that the ground station is on the same Wi-Fi network as the server, enabling smooth and real-time communication between components.
