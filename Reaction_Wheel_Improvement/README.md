# CubeSat Reaction Wheel Project

This repository contains all the essential elements created for the CubeSat Reaction Wheel project.

## Contents

- **3D_Simulation**: This directory contains all the Solidwork files updated specifically for the project. It includes the necessary files for the 3D simulation and modeling related to the CubeSat Reaction Wheel.

- **Arduino**: The Arduino directory houses the code essential for the SparkFun Arduino to operate within the Reaction Wheel project. 

- **KiCad**: This directory comprises the KiCad files, notably the "Kicad_V2" folder. It contains the electronic schema of the project's prototype and offers a potential version that can be translated into a PCB design, taking into account the components used.

## Usage

### 3D_Simulation

This directory includes Solidwork files that are crucial for 3D modeling. To utilize these files:

1. Ensure you have Solidwork installed on your system or another 3D visualisation tool.
2. Open the files using Solidwork to view the 3D model.

### Arduino

The Arduino directory holds the necessary code for the SparkFun Arduino to function within the Reaction Wheel project. Follow these steps:

1. Upload the code to your SparkFun Arduino board.
2. Ensure the connections are set up as specified in the documentation or comments within the code.

### KiCad

In this directory, particularly in the "Kicad_V2" folder, you'll find electronic schemas for the project's prototype and a potential PCB design. To use:

1. Open KiCad and load the schematic files for review or modification.
2. For PCB creation, follow the provided instructions or guidelines for creating a printed circuit board based on the schematic.

## Additional Notes

Please refer to individual directories for specific instructions, codes, or diagrams related to their respective components of the CubeSat Reaction Wheel project.
