# CubeSat Position Visualization Project

This repository includes three main directories representing different aspects of the CubeSat Position Visualization project.

## Directory Structure

### Arduino

The `arduino` directory contains the modified version of the code to be uploaded onto the SparkFun Pro Micro. This code facilitates the transmission of the CubeSat's three-dimensional positions but maintains the fundamental structure of the base code.

To upload the code:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the SparkFun Pro Micro.
3. Load the modified code from the `arduino` directory.
4. Verify and upload the code to the SparkFun Pro Micro.

### Processing

The `processing` directory contains files related to initial visualization tests conducted using the Processing software. However, these files represent early attempts and are not part of the finalized project.

### Visu Web

The `visu_web` directory contains the entire web server setup necessary for near real-time visualization on a web page. Refer to the README within the `visu_web` directory for detailed installation instructions.

To set up the web visualization:

1. Navigate to the `visu_web` directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the README file to install the required dependencies and set up the web server.
3. Access the web page to visualize CubeSat positions in near real-time.

## Additional Notes

Please refer to the specific directories for detailed instructions and information regarding each component of the CubeSat Position Visualization project.
